- 👋 Hi, I’m @MKFELICIEN
- 👀 I’m interested in understanding of the problem and the solution, trying out new frameworks, solving tricky issues with new algorithms, and using a different methodology.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, Java, React JS and data base.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Microsoft's Visual Studio Live Share.
- 📫 you can reach out to me on facebook (BJ OG).
